# Title: Cryptographically secure federated learning for healthcare consortia

The project is a Centralized Federated Learning setup for prediction of Chest diseases. The system is cryptographically secured to protect from attacks on the shared weight in order to ensure privacy. Cryptograms approach is used for applying cryptographic techniques.

There are three code files

1. CNN model: Contains the CNN model for ChestMNIST dataset.
2. FL model: Consist of Federated Learning model (mechanism)  applied by distributing dataset among 3 clients
3. Cryptograms: The implementation of the mechanism Cryptograms


Recommended Requirements:

- Processor: Intel Core i7
- RAM: 32 GB DDR4
- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070
- Operating System: Windows 10
- Python 3 environment with all the required libraries installed


Required Libraries:

- CNN:  medmnist, Numpy, Torch, TorchVision, tqdm
- FL model: medmnist, OS, Numpy, Torch, TorchVision, tqdm
- Cryptograms: Coordinates, dataclass



Steps to run the code:

1. Download the files
2. Run the files on a platform for python files like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
